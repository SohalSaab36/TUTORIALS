## HTML Learning Chat

**Amogh**: Hey Amrit, have you started learning HTML yet?

**Amrit**: Yeah, I just started this week. It’s pretty interesting! I didn’t know websites were made using such simple code.

**Amogh**: I know, right? HTML is basically the skeleton of a web page. It tells the browser what to display.

**Amrit**: Exactly! I learned about some basic tags like `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`. Everything goes inside these.

**Amogh**: That’s right. And inside the `<body>`, you can use tags like `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings and `<p>` for paragraphs.

**Amrit**: Oh, I used the `<img>` tag to add an image. I had to use the `src` attribute to give the image path.

**Amogh**: Nice! And don’t forget the `<a>` tag. It’s used to create hyperlinks. I made a link to Google using `<a href="https://www.google.com">Click Here</a>`.

**Amrit**: That’s cool. Do you know how to create a list?

**Amogh**: Yeah! You can use `<ul>` for an unordered list and `<ol>` for an ordered list. Inside those, you use `<li>` for each list item.

**Amrit**: HTML feels easy so far. But I heard you need CSS to make your website look nice?

**Amogh**: True! HTML structures the content, and CSS styles it. But it’s good to get comfortable with HTML first.

**Amrit**: Agreed. I’m planning to create a simple personal web page as practice. Want to do it together?

**Amogh**: Sure! Let’s do it after class. It’ll be fun.
